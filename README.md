# raycast
An implementation of The Coding Train's 2D ray casting simulation.

## Installation
Clone the repository where you want it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PrestonGray/raycast.git
```

## Usage
My current implementation uses Visual Studio Code and the Express extension to host.

Upon opening VSCode, select `add workspace folder` and choose the raycast directory. 

Open the Command Pallete and run the command `Express: Host Current Workspace and Open in Browser`.

A new window should open with the simulation running. The ball of light will follow your mouse, so move it around and have fun!
